<p class="his1" align="justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Growing up, Lovely Danganan already set her eyes to business. Their family used to run a coffee shop business when she was in college. Because of her passion for business, she took her internship in the United States of America. There she worked for Hyatt Hotels and became a barista at Starbucks. She then finally realized that she wanted to pursue her own line of business with her own expertise. On December, she returned to the Philippines and started planning out the business. Together with her boyfriend, they put up Beantage Coffee Shop to life in April. </p>
